### This is based off of @m1k1o's [Chat](https://github.com/m1k1o/chat/)
_This repo isn't a fork because replit can't handle cloning repossitories and then forking the code from the original with all the changes from replit into a new repo :|_
# chat
Simple plug & play real-time JavaScript chat implemented using Socket.io.

Where simplicity meets usability:

* No user accounts - just enter nickname and join.
* No history saved - only logged-in users can see recent history.
* No configuration.
* Only one room - you can't create any other rooms or write PM to others.
* Files sharing is possible - without storing any data on server.
* Emojis - just a few of them.
